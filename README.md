Q) If you try to attach an Amazon EBS volume that was created in Availability Zone Y to an EC2 instance in Availability Zone X, it wonâ€™t work â€” AWS will block the operation.

ðŸš« Why It Fails
EBS volumes are zone-specific, meaning:
- You can only attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone.
- If the volume and instance are in different zones, AWS will return an error and prevent the attachment.
âœ… How to Fix It
If you need the volume in a different zone:
- Create a snapshot of the EBS volume.
- Restore a new volume from that snapshot in the target Availability Zone (Zone X).
- Attach the new volume to your EC2 instance in Zone X.
This process ensures data portability across zones while respecting AWSâ€™s architecture constraints.


Summary:
If you try to attach an EBS volume created in Availability Zone Y to an EC2 instance in Zone X, it will fail because EBS volumes are zone-specific.
âœ… To resolve this:
- Create a snapshot of the volume in Zone Y
- Use that snapshot to create a new volume in Zone X
- Attach the new volume to your EC2 instance in Zone X
